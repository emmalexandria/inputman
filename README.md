**Want an actually usable input system for the web? Just call `inputman`!**

inputman (input manager) is a Typescript library for handling keyboard inputs on the web in a sensible way. It comes in a few flavours including:

- Static class methods.
- Helper functions.
- Instance methods for more advanced uses.

It uses only 100% pure DOM APIs (for your inputting pleasure).
